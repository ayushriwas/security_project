# security_project

The terraform files are for only creating the vpc networks infrastructure which contains the two security groups, one security group has the permissions for ssh access etc...
These files do not have any involvement in the project I just configured terraform for the purpose of creating the vpc  network which helped me to save charges of aws vpc.

so you can ignore them.
